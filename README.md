docker-compose up --build
Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Backend: http://localhost:5000/api/signup

💡 Development Notes
React app sends POST requests to http://localhost:5000/api/signup

Express logs the form data and returns a success message

You can extend this project to store data in a database (e.g., MongoDB)

📁 Signup Component (client/src/Signup.js)
Your React component handles form submission, success, and error feedback with a real API call to Express.

🧼 Best Practices in Docker Multi-Stage Build
Separate build and run stages: Prevents large build artifacts from bloating the final image.

Use lightweight base images: Alpine or NGINX for frontend, official Node for backend.

Optimize dependencies: Only include production dependencies in the final container.
